## 👇 Getting Started 👇<br/>


### How It's made:<br/>

**Tech used** 🖥️: <br/>
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS

- This is my first project using react, I made it with the inspiration of turning the outdated version of the Quickly Website into a more sleek modern designed Website.<br>
- Other than the library **'aos animations'**, every thing else is pure css.<br>
- I used React to break down each page into its own component.<br>


## Lessons Learned and Final Thoughts 🧠:

- Overall I am proud of this website, the frontend is amazing and keeps the user engaged, it is also mobile responsive. <br>

- Something I that I want to implement inthe future though is a backend. 
<br>
- I didn't know backend at this time but now that I have experience with it, I would like to use firebase as the user auth and menu storage and use Stripe to handle payments.


## Known bugs 🥲


- Scrolling down then switching to another page component doesn't auto scroll user back to top. <br>
- The checkout system is kind of buggy, as I didn't go far to into it because there is no backend part, which I can do though, so items are stored in user localstorage or cookies when refreshing. <br>
- There should also be a +1 then a number of how many items are in their cart updated in the menu nav or somewhere on the page to show their checkout updating.
